# Welcome

This is an example site to demo using [mkdocs-macros-plugin](https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs_macros_plugin) with YAML to generate content.

mkdocs-macros-plugin allows you to use variables and macros in your MkDocs sites. It's a powerful tool, and I recommend reading the [mkdocs-macros documentation](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn more about it.

This site focuses on one task: using YAML to define variables that you can then use in your site. This can range from pulling in something from your `mkdocs.yml` and displaying it in your content, to using extra YAML files to generate page contents.

!!! note "There's a lot more to this plugin"
    This collection of examples focuses on YAML format sources, and how to display them. The plugin allows for a lot more than just using YAML as a source format. It includes built-in access to things like the system environment, and support for creating your own modules and pluglets.
